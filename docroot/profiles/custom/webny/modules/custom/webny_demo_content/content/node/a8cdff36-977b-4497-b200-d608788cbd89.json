            "value": "<p>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that several of the state\u2019s leading women's advocacy groups, including the National Organization for Women, the Campaign for a Pro-Choice New York and the League of Women Voters of New York State, have joined the \"Strong Families, Strong New York\" campaign to fight for passage of paid family leave in New York State. These groups are endorsing the Governor's proposal for 12 weeks of paid benefits, funded by employees, to allow workers to care for new children or seriously ill relatives. The Governor\u2019s proposal would benefit millions of New Yorkers \u2013 especially women, minorities and low-income workers who need it most \u2013 in addition to businesses and the economy overall, and would be the most robust such policy in the nation.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"Ensuring that all working men and women have access to paid family leave isn\u2019t just good policy, it\u2019s the right thing to do,\"&nbsp;Governor Cuomo said.&nbsp;\"New Yorkers should be able to be with their families in times of need without having to put their economic security at risk and that's exactly what this plan ensures. Family and community are two defining characteristics of this state and its time that we start living that way again.\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>National Organization for Women-NYS President Sonia Ossorio said,&nbsp;<\/strong>\"Time spent with a newborn baby is important\u2013 not only for the child\u2019s health, but for a mother's wellbeing as well. Unfortunately, too many working parents are forced to cut this time short because they do not have access to paid family leave. Governor Cuomo\u2019s proposal would allow these parents to spend more time with their babies and give them a stronger, more holistic start from the very beginning. I\u2019m proud to support this smart proposal because no one should have to choose between making a living and caring for their loved ones.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Andrea Miller, President of the National Institute for Reproductive Health Action Fund and its Campaign for a Pro-Choice New York said,<\/strong>&nbsp;\"Full equality for women is impossible without the ability to decide when and whether to have children \u2013 and the structural supports to exercise those rights. Governor Cuomo's paid family leave proposal would help families actualize their decision to parent by ensuring financial stability. No one should have to choose between making a living and planning the families they want to have.\"&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>League of Women Voters of NYS President Dare Thompson said<\/strong>, \"The League of Women Voters applauds Governor Cuomo for pushing his 12-week paid family leave insurance program. When an employee is unable to work, the League believes that they should be entitled to income sufficient to meet basic human needs. We support the establishment of a paid family leave insurance which will benefit all employees, regardless of race or gender, should they face a family crisis.\"&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWomen's groups pushing for the passage of paid family leave in New York State include:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>National Organization for Women (NOW) - NYS<\/li>\r\n\t<li>National Institute for Reproductive Health Action Fund and its Campaign for a Pro-Choice New York<\/li>\r\n\t<li>League of Women Voters \u2013 NY<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Eleanor's Legacy<\/li>\r\n\t<li>New York State Nurses Association<\/li>\r\n\t<li>YWCA of New York City<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Women's City Club of NY<\/li>\r\n\t<li>STEPS<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Westchester Women's Agenda<\/li>\r\n\t<li>NOW- Westchester<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Hope's Door<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A Better Balance<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Legal Momentum<\/li>\r\n\t<li>National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Girls Inc. of Long Island<\/li>\r\n\t<li>American Association of University Women of New York State<\/li>\r\n\t<li>American Association of University Women of Long Island<\/li>\r\n\t<li>America Association of University Women of Rockland County Branch<\/li>\r\n\t<li>SEPA Mujer<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Women Builders Council<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Womenservices &amp; the Birthing Center of Buffalo<\/li>\r\n\t<li>YWCA of Greater Rochester<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Womensphere Foundation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>100 Hispanic Women National, Inc.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br \/>\r\nAdditionally, numerous Long Island elected officials, community groups, advocacy organizations and faith leaders are supporting the Governor's plan.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Assemblyman Phil Ramos said,<\/strong>&nbsp;\"Paid family leave is an issue of basic fairness and I commend Governor Cuomo for shining the spotlight it. All across this state, honest and hard-working New Yorkers are forced to make a choice between feeding their families and being with them when it matters the most and the time for change is now. Thankfully, no one understands the importance of family more than Governor Cuomo and I am proud to stand with him in support of New York\u2019s working families.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said,<\/strong>&nbsp;\"I support the fight for paid family leave, because no working families should have to sacrifice their financial security to tend to their loved ones in time of need. I applaud Governor Cuomo for leading the way on this fight and I am hopeful that New York will once again lead the nation by supporting progressive policies which improve quality of life for working men and women.\"<\/p>\r\n",
