Cuomo today announced that applications are now being accepted for the third year of&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.43north.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">43North<\/a>. The $5 million competition attracts entrepreneurs from around the world to compete for prizes that turn startups with high growth potential into funded enterprises in the Western New York region.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"After two years, the 43North competition has attracted some of the world's brightest and most innovative entrepreneurs to Buffalo and in year three, we will continue to carry them momentum forward,\"&nbsp;<strong>said Governor Cuomo.&nbsp;<\/strong>\"With Western New York rapidly becoming home to so many forward-thinking businesses, we must commit to making the targeted investments that are critical to growing the industries on the cutting edge of innovation.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe 2016 competition includes a revised prize structure that now features a grand prize of $1 million, a runner-up prize of $600,000, and six $500,000 awards. An additional $400,000 will be awarded to winners as incentivized follow-on funding. Part of the Governor Cuomo's Buffalo Billion initiative, the competition operates through $6 million in support from the New York Power Authority and $1 million from Empire State Development. The funding beyond the prize money is used to cover operational costs and to help ensure 43North continues to both attract new competitors and support last year's winners as they begin their work in Buffalo.&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"The 43North competition is a proven investment in innovative ideas that will continue to transform Buffalo and the entire Western New York economy,\"&nbsp;<strong>said Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul.&nbsp;<\/strong>\"Each winner has the potential to grow into a thriving business that will create jobs and help our economy. As someone who calls Buffalo home, I can speak to the Renaissance underway -- and it\u2019s because of pioneering projects like 43North, supported by Governor Cuomo's visionary Buffalo Billion initiative.\"\u200b<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>43North Executive Director John T. Gavigan said,<\/strong>&nbsp;\"Anyone with a rock-solid startup has a legitimate chance to make their dreams come true through the 43North competition. The 43North team is excited to spread Governor Cuomo's message of opportunity throughout North America and around the globe, as we will yet again undertake several roadshow stops to engage entrepreneurs from all backgrounds, sectors, industries and walks of life. We also look forward to sharing the many wonderful qualities of Buffalo\u2019s startup culture with these bold, exciting businesspeople.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>New York Power Authority Chairman<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>John R. Koelmel<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>said,<\/strong>&nbsp;\"We knew that Governor Cuomo\u2019s 43 North initiative would forever alter the business landscape in Western New York and the State, but the results to date have far exceeded NYPA's expectations. I am proud that our funding will continue to play a vital role in ensuring that the region remains at the epicenter of a global movement toward a more innovative and technically diversified economy.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Similar to last year, the 43North competition will be broken down into three rounds:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Round 1 (March 4 \u2013 May 31, 2016): Applications will be accepted via the competition\u2019s website,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.43north.org\/\">43north.org<\/a>. The purpose of Round 1 is for applicants to provide a vision for their venture, including their business concept, target customers, industry overview, competitive landscape, and revenue potential. This year, 43North will be charging an application fee of $100, with an early bird fee of $50 for companies that submit their applications by March 31.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Round 2 (Summer 2016): Semifinalists will be announced.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Round 3 (October 2016): Up to 20 finalist teams will pitch their business in person to a panel of judges in Buffalo. The competition concludes with a celebration of 8 selected winners.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>43North is open to applicants ages 18 and older in any industry, with the exception of bricks-and-mortar retail and hospitality.

Buffalo has become a key part of our identity and the funding and resources from 43North have helped to build a strong foundation needed for us to be viable and competitive. We were so pleased to be a part of the inaugural competition, and can't wait to see the businesses that will come out of year three.\"&nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Co-Founder and CEO of Plum Caitlin MacGregor said<\/strong>, \"The prize we were awarded from the second 43North competition was a transformational moment for our company.
