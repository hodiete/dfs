+# Change log
+
+### v0.11.0
+
+* Added `reuseModelViews` option. Set to false to completely recreate model views on each render.
+
+### v0.10.1
+
+* Brought npm package version in sync with Bower package. How'd that happen?
+* Fixed issue that could surface when setting multiple models using collection.set (#50)
+
+### v0.9.3
+
+* Fixed UMD wrapper.
+
+### v0.9.2
+
+* Added UMD wrapper.
+
+### v0.9.0
+
+* No longer re-render upon add() and remove() events in the collection.
+* Due to the above, "render" events no longer trigger during add() or remove() calls on a collection.
+* Made use of backbone.viewOptions by including it and updating the source to use it's facilities.
+
+### v0.8.2
+
+* Patch for better bower support.
+
+### v0.8.1
+
+* If a modelView's element is an <li>, don't wrap in an extra <li> when rendering
+* Fix accidental item removal after sort stop when rendering as table.
+* Add sortableOptions constructor option which is passed through to the created jQuery sortable.
+
+### v0.8
+
+* data-item-id attribute has been changed to data-model-cid for clarity
+* selectableModelsFilter can no longer be a string.
+* After the collection view is reordered via dragging: if the collection has a comparator, sort after adding all the models in the visual order.
+* Never "rerender" the collection view unless it has already been rendered.  For example, adding models to the collection should not render the collection view if it was not previously rendered.
+* Don't listen to events from old collection when setOptions( "collection", newCollection ) is called
+
+### v0.7.1
+
+* Use css classes to keep track of and determine visibility of an item
+* Call remove() on views in viewManager when they are removed (so they stop listening to events)
+* Add `detachedRendering` option (defaults to `false`) to improve performance by rendering all modelViews before inserting into the DOM.
+
+### v0.7.0
+
+* Fix to work with underscore.js 1.5.1 (remove `_.bindAll` and use `.bind` where necessary).
+* Listen for `mousedown` event instead of `click` when `clickToSelect` is enabled.
+* Hide empty list caption when dragging item into a `sortable` collection view.
+
+### v0.6.5
+
+* Model views that represent a particular model are now reused between renders.

+# Backbone.CollectionView
+
+__For demos see [the Backbone.CollectionView home page](http://rotundasoftware.github.com/backbone.collectionView/).__
+
+Depends on jQuery and jQueryUI for event handling and sorting, respectively.
+
+## Benefits
+
+* Renders a collection of models, updating automatically when models are added or removed.
+* Keeps track of selected model(s) and fires events when the selection is changed.
+* Adds "selected" css class to selected model views for easy stying.
+* Supports single and multiple selection through meta-key and shift clicks.
+* Allows a user to reorder the collection by dragging and dropping.
+* Supports changing the currently selected model(s) through up and down arrow key presses.
+* Allows you to filter which models are visible, selectable, and sortable.
+* Integrates with [Backbone.Courier](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/backbone.courier) out of the box.
+
+## Sample Usage
+```javascript
+var myCollectionView = new Backbone.CollectionView( {
+	el : $( "#listForCollection" ),		// must be a 'ul' (i.e. unordered list) or 'table' element
+	modelView : EmployeeView,			// a View class to be used for rendering each model in the collection
+	collection : employeeCollection
+} );
+
+myCollectionView.render();
+myCollectionView.setSelectedModel( employeeCollection.first() );
+```
+
+## Initialization Options
+* `el` : A `<ul>` or `<table>` element into which your collection will be rendered. If you supply a `<table>` element, your modelView must have an element of type of `<tr>`.
+* `collection` : The collection of models to be rendered.
+* `modelView` : A view constructor that will be used to create the views for each individual model.
+* `selectable` : (default: _true_) Determines whether models in the CollectionView are selectable.
+* `reuseModelViews` : (default: _true_) When `true`, modelViews are reused instead of being re-created from scratch when the CollectionView is re-rendered.
+* `detachedRendering` : (default: _false_) When `true`, all the modelViews are rendered before being added to the DOM to improve performance. If your modelView rendering relies on its location in the DOM (for sizing or other reasons), use the default value of `false`.
+* `sortable` : (default: _false_) Determines if models can be rearranged by dragging and dropping.
+* `sortableOptions` : Options passed through to the created jQueryUI sortable.  Only applies if `sortable`.
+* `emptyListCaption` : A string (or a function returning a string) to be shown when the list is empty.
+
+The following options apply when `selectable` option is set:
+
+* `clickToSelect` : (default: _true_) Determines whether mouse clicks should automatically select models as would be appropriate in a standard HTML mutli-SELECT element.
+* `processKeyEvents` : (default: _true_) Determines if the collection view should respond to arrow key events as would be appropriate in a standard HTML multi-SELECT element.
+* `selectMultiple` : (default: _false_) Determines if multiple models can be selected at once.
+* `clickToToggle` : (default: _false_) Determines if clicking a model view should toggle its selected / unselected state. Only applies if `selectMultiple` is set.
+
+The following options expect a filter function that takes a single parameter, the model in question, and returns `true` or `false`. They are all optional, defaulting to passing all models.
+* `visibleModelsFilter` : Determines which models are visible. 
+* `selectableModelsFilter` : In a selectable CollectionView, determines which models are selectable.
+* `sortableModelsFilter` : In a sortable CollectionView, determines which models are sortable.
+
+## <a name="api"></a>Methods and Properties Reference
+
+* __setSelectedModel( modelReference, [options] )__ Sets which model(s) are selected. (See below.)
+* __getSelectedModel( [options] )__ Returns references to the selected model(s). (See below.)
+* __setOption( optionName, optionValue )__ Updates the value of a configuration option.  All constructor options above are valid except `el`.  The CollectionView is automatically re-rendered if necessary.
+* __collection__ The Backbone collection instance that this CollectionView represents.
+* __viewManager__ A [Backbone.BabySitter](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter) instance that contains the views corresponding to the individual models in the collection. Backbone.Babysitter implements a "view collection" that enables you to, for example, iterate through all the model views, or easily trigger an event on all model views at once. See the [Backbone.BabySitter](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter) documentation for more information.
+
+
+### <a name="setSelectedModel"></a>setSelectedModel(s) and getSelectedModel(s)
+
+The `getSelectedModel(s)` and `setSelectedModel(s)` methods are used to get or set the currently selected models. The methods are able to reference models in a variety of ways using the `by` option:
+
+```javascript
+// Returns an array of the selected models
+myCollectionView.getSelectedModels();
+
+// Returns an array of the ids of the selected models
+myCollectionView.getSelectedModels( { by : "id" } );
+
+// Select model id 2 and model id 4
+myCollectionView.setSelectedModels( [ 2, 4 ], { by : "id" } );
+
+// Select the model with cid equal to "c21"
+myCollectionView.setSelectedModel( "c21", { by : "cid" } );
+
+// Returns the view object that represents the selected model
+myCollectionView.getSelectedModel( { by : "view" } );
+```
+
+As shown in the examples, the plural versions of the methods expect / return an array of "model references", whereas the singular versions expect / return just a single "model reference".
+
+There are four valid values for `by` option which determine the type of "model reference" used.
+* `"id"` : The `id` of the model.
+* `"cid"` : The `cid` of the model.
+* `"offset"` : The zero-based index of the model in the collection, only counting visible models.
+* `"view"` : The view that was created to represent the model when the CollectionView was rendered.
+
+If no `by` option is provided the model object itself is expected / returned.
+
+Additionally, the `setSelectedModel(s)` function accepts one additional option, `silent`, which, when true, will prevent the `selectionChanged` event from being fired.
+
+##Events Fired
+CollectionViews `trigger` the following events on themselves. If [Backbone.Courier](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/backbone.courier)
+ is available, these events are also "spawned".
+* __"selectionChanged"__ ( _newSelectedModels, oldSelectedModels_ )  Fired whenever the selection is changed, either by the user or by a programmatic call to `setSelectedModel(s)`.
+* __"updateDependentControls"__ ( _selectedModels_ ) Fired whenever controls that are dependent on the selection should be updated (e.g. buttons that should be disabled on no selection). This event is always fired just after `selectionChanged` is fired. In addition, it is fired after rendering and sorting.
+* __"doubleClick"__ ( _clickedModel_ ) Fired when a model view is double clicked.
+
+In addition, sortable CollectionViews fire these events:
+
+* __"sortStart"__  Fired just as a model view is starting to be dragged.
+* __"sortStop"__  Fired after a drag is finished and after the collection is reordered.
+* __"reorder"__  Fired when a drag is finished, but before the collection is reordered.
+
+##Styling
+
+How you style the collection view is up to you.
+
+The `ul` or `table` element that is used as the collection view's element will be given the `collection-list` class. Generally you will want to eliminate bullets, etc., from your collection view list elements, which you can do with these "base" styles:
+
+```css
+ul.collection-list {
+  margin: 0;
+  padding: 0;
+  list-style-type: none;
+  outline: none;
+  cursor: pointer;
+}
+```
+
+When a model is selected, its view's `li` or `tr` element will be given the `selected` class.
+
+You can style the caption created by the `emptyListCaption` option with the `var.empty-list-caption` selector. These styles will center the empty list caption text near the top of the collection view.
+
+```css
+var.empty-list-caption {
+  color: #A0A0A0;
+  padding: 30px;
+  display: block;
+  text-align: center;
+  font-style: normal;
+  line-height: 1.45;
+}
+```
+
+(Both of the above css fragments are included in `base.css`, which will be included automatically in your css bundles if you are using [parcelify](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/parcelify) or [cartero](https://github.com/rotundasoftware/cartero/).)

+Contribute
+==========
+
+
+> I have changed my branching model recently (November 2013)! Previously
+> the latest version was always in develop, and pull request had to be
+> made on this branch. This is no longer the case!
+
+
+The latest version is always in the **[master](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone)**
+branch.
+
+
+> Please provide a test for any new feature (see the [testing section](#testing) below).
+
+
+Communicate
+-----------
+
+Before you start implementing new features, please create an issue about
+it first and discuss your intent.
+
+It might be something that someone else is already implementing or that
+goes against the concepts of Dropzone, and I really hate rejecting pull
+requests others spent hours writing on.
+
+
+Developer Dependencies
+----------------------
+
+The first thing you need to do, is to install the developer dependencies:
+
+```bash
+$ npm install
+```
+
+This will install all the tools you need to compile the source files and to test
+the library.
+
+
+Coffeescript & Sass (-> Javascript & CSS)
+------------------------------------------
+
+Dropzone is written in [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) and
+[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) so *do not* make
+changes to the Javascript or CSS files
+
+**I will not merge requests written in Javascript or CSS.**
+
+Please don't include compiled `.js` or `.css` files in your pull requests but only
+`.coffee` or `.scss` files. That way pull requests aren't polluted and I can see
+immediately what you changed.
+
+
+To build the library use [grunt](http://gruntjs.com).
+
+```bash
+$ grunt -h # Displays available options
+$ grunt # compiles all coffeescript and stylus files
+$ grunt watch # watches for changes and builds on the fly
+```
+
+> I recommend using `grunt watch` when you begin developing. This way you can't
+> forget to compile the source files and will avoid headaches.
+
+
+Testing
+-------
+
+To test the library, open `test/test.html` in your browser or type `npm test`
+which will run the tests in your console in a headless browser.
+
+The tests are also written in coffeescript in the `test/test.coffee` file,
+and compiled with `grunt js` or `grunt watch`.
+
+
+* Thanks for contributing!*

+
+Dropzone.js is a light weight JavaScript library that turns an HTML element into a dropzone.
+This means that a user can drag and drop a file onto it, and the file gets uploaded to the server via AJAX.
+
+* * *
+
+_If you want support, please use [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) with the `dropzone.js` tag and not the
+GitHub issues tracker. Only post an issue here if you think you discovered a bug or have a feature request._
+
+* * *
+
+**Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start working on Dropzone!**
+
+<br>
+<div align="center">

+</div>
+<br>
+<br>
+
+
+Starting with version 2.0.0 this library does no longer depend on jQuery (but
+it still works as a jQuery module).
+
+Dropzone is compatible with [component](https://github.com/component/component),
+there's a standalone version and an [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)
+module that's compatible with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) in the downloads
+folder.
+
+<img slt="Dropzone Screenshot" width="585" src="http://i.imgur.com/Xf7QvVG.png" />
+
+
+
+## Main features
+
+- Image thumbnail previews. Simply register the callback `thumbnail(file, data)` and display the image wherever you like
+- Retina enabled
+- Multiple files and synchronous uploads
+- Progress updates
+- Support for large files
+- Complete theming. The look and feel of Dropzone is just the default theme. You
+  can define everything yourself by overwriting the default event listeners.
+- Well tested
+
+## Documentation
+
+For the full documentation and installation please visit www.dropzonejs.com
+
+Please also refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki/FAQ).
+
+## Examples
+
+For examples, please see the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/wiki).
+
+## Usage
+
+Implicit creation:
+
+```html
+<form id="my-awesome-dropzone" action="/target" class="dropzone"></form>
+```
+
+That's it. Really!
+
+Dropzone will automatically attach to it, and handle file drops.
+
+Want more control? You can configure dropzones like this:
+
+```js
+// "myAwesomeDropzone" is the camelized version of the ID of your HTML element
+Dropzone.options.myAwesomeDropzone = { maxFilesize: 1 };
+```
+
+...or instantiate dropzone manually like this:
+
+```js
+new Dropzone("div#my-dropzone", { /* options */ });
+```
+
+> Note that dropzones don't have to be forms. But if you choose another element you have to pass the `url` parameter in the options.
+
+For configuration options please look at the [documentation on the website](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration)
+or at the [source](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone/blob/master/src/dropzone.coffee#L90).
+
+
+
+### Register for events
+
+If you want to register to some event you can do so on the `dropzone` object itself:
+
+```js
+Dropzone.options.myDropzone({
+  init: function() {
+    this.on("error", function(file, message) { alert(message); });
+  }
+});
+// or if you need to access a Dropzone somewhere else:
+var myDropzone = Dropzone.forElement("div#my-dropzone");
+myDropzone.on("error", function(file, message) { alert(message); });
+```
+
+For a list of all events, please look at the chapter 
+[»Events«](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#events) in the documentation
+or at the [source](src/dropzone.coffee#L43).
+
+
+## Browser support
+
+- Chrome 7+
+- Firefox 4+
+- IE 10+
+- Opera 12+ (Version 12 for MacOS is disabled because their API is buggy)
+- Safari 6+
+
+For all the other browsers, dropzone provides an oldschool file input fallback.
+
+## Why another library?
+
+I realize that there [are](http://valums.com/ajax-upload/) [already](http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/html5-file-upload-jquery-php/) [other](http://code.google.com/p/html5uploader/) [libraries](http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/) out there but the reason I decided to write my own are the following:
+
+- I didn't want it to be too big, and to cumbersome to dive into.
+- I want to design my own elements. I only want to register callbacks so I can update my elements accordingly.
+- Big files should get uploaded without a problem.
+- I wanted a callback for image previews, that don't kill the browser if too many too big images are viewed.
+- I want to use the latest API of browsers. I don't care if it falls back to the normal upload form if the browser is too old.
+- I don't think that it's necessary anymore to depend on libraries such as jQuery (especially when providing functionality that isn't available in old browsers anyway).

+    Those functions register themselves to the events on init and handle all
+    the user interface specific stuff. Overwriting them won't break the upload
+    but can break the way it's displayed.
+    You can overwrite them if you don't like the default behavior. If you just
+    want to add an additional event handler, register it on the dropzone object
+    and don't overwrite those options.

+# ES6-Promise (subset of [rsvp.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js))
+
+This is a polyfill of the [ES6 Promise](http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-promise-constructor). The implementation is a subset of [rsvp.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js) extracted by @jakearchibald, if you're wanting extra features and more debugging options, check out the [full library](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js).
+
+For API details and how to use promises, see the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/">JavaScript Promises HTML5Rocks article</a>.
+
+## Downloads
+
+* [es6-promise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise/master/dist/es6-promise.js)
+* [es6-promise-min](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise/master/dist/es6-promise.min.js)
+
+## Node.js
+
+To install:
+
+```sh
+npm install es6-promise
+```
+
+To use:
+
+```js
+var Promise = require('es6-promise').Promise;
+```
+
+## Bower
+
+To install:
+
+```sh
+bower install es6-promise --save
+```
+
+
+## Usage in IE<9
+
+`catch` is a reserved word in IE<9, meaning `promise.catch(func)` throws a syntax error. To work around this, you can use a string to access the property as shown in the following example.
+
+However, please remember that such technique is already provided by most common minifiers, making the resulting code safe for old browsers and production:
+
+```js
+promise['catch'](function(err) {
+  // ...
+});
+```
+
+Or use `.then` instead:
+
+```js
+promise.then(undefined, function(err) {
+  // ...
+});
+```
+
+## Auto-polyfill
+
+To polyfill the global environment (either in Node or in the browser via CommonJS) use the following code snippet:
+
+```js
+require('es6-promise').polyfill();
+```
+
+Notice that we don't assign the result of `polyfill()` to any variable. The `polyfill()` method will patch the global environment (in this case to the `Promise` name) when called.
+
+## Building & Testing
+
+You will need to have PhantomJS installed globally in order to run the tests.
+
+`npm install -g phantomjs`
+
+* `npm run build` to build
+* `npm test` to run tests
+* `npm start` to run a build watcher, and webserver to test
+* `npm run test:server` for a testem test runner and watching builder

+    /**
+      Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
+      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which
+      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason
+      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.
+
+      Terminology
+      -----------
+
+      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
+      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.
+      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).
+      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.
+      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.
+      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.
+
+      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
+
+      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled
+      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the
+      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.
+
+      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a
+      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's
+      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will
+      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will
+      itself fulfill.
+
+
+      Basic Usage:
+      ------------
+
+      ```js
+      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
+        // on success
+        resolve(value);
+
+        // on failure
+        reject(reason);
+      });
+
+      promise.then(function(value) {
+        // on fulfillment
+      }, function(reason) {
+        // on rejection
+      });
+      ```
+
+      Advanced Usage:
+      ---------------
+
+      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as
+      `XMLHttpRequest`s.
+
+      ```js
+      function getJSON(url) {
+        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
+          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
+
+          xhr.open('GET', url);
+          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;

+      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,
+
+    /**
+      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,
+      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the
+      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.
+
+      ```js
+      findUser().then(function(user){
+        // user is available
+      }, function(reason){
+        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why
+      });
+      ```
+
+      Chaining
+      --------
+
+      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'
+      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment
+      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.
+
+      ```js
+      findUser().then(function (user) {
+        return user.name;
+      }, function (reason) {
+        return 'default name';
+      }).then(function (userName) {
+        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it
+        // will be `'default name'`
+      });
+
+      findUser().then(function (user) {
+        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');
+      }, function (reason) {
+        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');
+      }).then(function (value) {
+        // never reached
+      }, function (reason) {
+        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.
+        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.
+      });
+      ```
+      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.
+
+      ```js
+      findUser().then(function (user) {
+        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');
+      }).then(function (value) {
+        // never reached
+      }).then(function (value) {
+        // never reached
+      }, function (reason) {
+        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here
+      });
+      ```
+
+      Assimilation
+      ------------
+
+      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be
+      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the
+      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending
+      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.
+
+      ```js
+      findUser().then(function (user) {
+        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
+      }).then(function (comments) {
+        // The user's comments are now available
+      });
+      ```
+
+      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.
+
+      ```js
+      findUser().then(function (user) {
+        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
+      }).then(function (comments) {
+        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here
+      }, function (reason) {
+        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here
+      });
+      ```
+
+      Simple Example
+      --------------
+
+      Synchronous Example
+
+      ```javascript
+      var result;
+
+      try {

+/**
+  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
+  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which
+  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason
+  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.
+
+  Terminology
+  -----------
+
+  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
+  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.
+  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).
+  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.
+  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.
+  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.
+
+  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
+
+  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled
+  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the
+  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.
+
+  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a
+  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's
+  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will
+  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will
+  itself fulfill.
+
+
+  Basic Usage:
+  ------------
+
+  ```js
+  var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
+    // on success
+    resolve(value);
+
+    // on failure
+    reject(reason);
+  });
+
+  promise.then(function(value) {
+    // on fulfillment
+  }, function(reason) {
+    // on rejection
+  });
+  ```
+
+  Advanced Usage:
+  ---------------
+
+  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as
+  `XMLHttpRequest`s.
+
+  ```js
+  function getJSON(url) {
+    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
+      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
+
+      xhr.open('GET', url);
+      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
+      xhr.responseType = 'json';
+      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');
+      xhr.send();
+
+      function handler() {
+        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {
+          if (this.status === 200) {
+            resolve(this.response);
+          } else {
+            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));
+          }
+        }
+      };
+    });
+  }
+
+  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {
+    // on fulfillment
+  }, function(reason) {
+    // on rejection
+  });
+  ```
+
+  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.
+
+  ```js
+  Promise.all([
+    getJSON('/posts'),
+    getJSON('/comments')
+  ]).then(function(values){
+    values[0] // => postsJSON
+    values[1] // => commentsJSON
+
+    return values;
+  });
+  ```
+
+  @class Promise
+  @param {function} resolver
+  Useful for tooling.
+  @constructor
+*/
+function Promise(resolver) {
+  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();
+  this._result = this._state = undefined;
+  this._subscribers = [];
+
+  if (noop !== resolver) {
+    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();
+    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();
+  }
+}
+
+Promise.all = all;
+Promise.race = race;
+Promise.resolve = Resolve;
+Promise.reject = Reject;
+Promise._setScheduler = setScheduler;
+Promise._setAsap = setAsap;
+Promise._asap = asap;
+
+Promise.prototype = {
+  constructor: Promise,
+
+/**
+  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,
+  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the
+  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.
+
+  ```js
+  findUser().then(function(user){
+    // user is available
+  }, function(reason){
+    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why
+  });
+  ```
+
+  Chaining
+  --------
+
+  The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'
+  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment
+  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.
+
+  ```js
+  findUser().then(function (user) {
+    return user.name;
+  }, function (reason) {
+    return 'default name';
+  }).then(function (userName) {
+    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it
+    // will be `'default name'`
+  });
+
+  findUser().then(function (user) {
+    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');
+  }, function (reason) {
+    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');
+  }).then(function (value) {
+    // never reached
+  }, function (reason) {
+    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.
+    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.
+  });
+  ```
+  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.
+
+  ```js
+  findUser().then(function (user) {
+    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');
+  }).then(function (value) {
+    // never reached
+  }).then(function (value) {
+    // never reached
+  }, function (reason) {
+    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here
+  });
+  ```
+
+  Assimilation
+  ------------
+
+  Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be
+  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the
+  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending
+  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.
+
+  ```js
+  findUser().then(function (user) {
+    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
+  }).then(function (comments) {
+    // The user's comments are now available
+  });
+  ```
+
+  If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.
+
+  ```js
+  findUser().then(function (user) {
+    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
+  }).then(function (comments) {
+    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here
+  }, function (reason) {
+    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here
+  });
+  ```
+
+  Simple Example
+  --------------
+
+  Synchronous Example
+
+  ```javascript
+  var result;
+
+  try {
+    result = findResult();
+    // success
+  } catch(reason) {
+    // failure
+  }
+  ```
+
+  Errback Example
+
+  ```js
+  findResult(function(result, err){
+    if (err) {
+      // failure
+    } else {
+      // success
+    }
+  });
+  ```

+  findResult().then(function(result){
+    // success

+    // failure

+  ```

+/**
+  `Promise.all` accepts an array of promises, and returns a new promise which

+  var promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];
+
+  Promise.all(promises).then(function(array){

+  });
+  ```
+
+  If any of the `promises` given to `all` are rejected, the first promise
+  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promises's
+  rejection handler. For example:
+
+  Example:
+
+  ```javascript
+  var promise1 = resolve(1);
+  var promise2 = reject(new Error("2"));

+0.3.3 IE8 compatibility fix.

+0.3.1 Added "disappear" event. Removed first argument (callback function) from $.fn.appear function. "appear" event is now triggered for each appeared element (before it was triggered only for a first element in selector).

+# jQuery.appear
+
+This is a total revamp of original jquery.appear plugin hosted on http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/
+
+Check <a href="http://morr.github.com/appear.html">demo page</a>!
+
+This plugin can be used to prevent unnecessary processeing for content that is hidden or is outside of the browser viewport.
+
+It implements a custom *appear*/*disappear* events which are fired when an element became visible/invisible in the browser viewport.
+
+        $('someselector').appear(); // It supports optional hash with "force_process" and "interval" keys. Check source code for details.
+
+        $('<div>test</div>').appear(); // It also supports raw DOM nodes wrapped in jQuery.
+
+        $('someselector').on('appear', function(event, $all_appeared_elements) {
+          // this element is now inside browser viewport
+        });
+        $('someselector').on('disappear', function(event, $all_disappeared_elements) {
+          // this element is now outside browser viewport
+        });
+
+If you want to fire *appear* event for elements which are close to viewport but are not visible yet, you may add data attributes *appear-top-offset* and *appear-left-offset* to DOM nodes.
+
+        <div class="postloader" data-appear-top-offset="600">...</div> # appear will be fired when an element is below browser viewport for 600 or less pixels
+
+Appear check can be forced by calling *$.force_appear()*. This is suitable in cases when page is in initial state (not scrolled and not resized) and when you want manually trigger appearance check.
+
+Also this plugin provides custom jQuery filter for manual checking element appearance.
+
+        $('someselector').is(':appeared')
