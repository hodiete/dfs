# NDD-172 Determine Layout Strategy

**Date:**  March 14, 2016 

**Who:**  Gregg Marshall with group consensus, Lindsey Catlett present

**Problem:**  Determine how the distribution will do layout.  Options (more than one can be selected): 
- Panels 
- Blocks 
- Paragraphs 
- Display Suite 
- Context

**Recommendation:** Paragraphs for user adjustable Frame implementation along with Drupal 8 core block system, which is fieldable.

**Reasoning:** We need Paragraphs to implement the requested Frame types and allow for positioning by the content authors.  Drupal 8's core blocks have become considerably more flexible than previous versions of Drupal and are fully integrated into Drupal 8 caching.
