# NDD-113 File and Media Handling

**Date:**  March 14, 2016 

**Who:**  Acquia Recommendation

**Problem:**  During discovery the Digital Team asked for a single user interface for media assets, images and videos, as well as documents during content maintenance.  The Media suite of modules was identified as the most likely solution for images and videos, the question was could it accommodate the needs for documents.

**Recommendation:** Keep media assets in Media, documents in a separate content type.

**Reasoning:** Insufficient time for a full spike to research the options for MVP.  Risk is the requirement will resurface and require redesign.
