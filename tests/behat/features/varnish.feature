Feature: Varnish Cache Clearing
  -Check to make sure the Varnish is behaving as expected

  Background:
    Given "webny_news_subject_heading" terms:
      | name      |
      | Behat     |
      | Justin    |
      | Winter    |

  # Check that varnish is up and running
  Scenario: See if proper header value is returned
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I am on "/"
    Then I should see in the header "Via":"1.1 varnish"


  Scenario: Create and News node with fields
    Given I am viewing an "webny_news" content:
    | title | My article with fields! |
    | body  | A placeholder           |
    | field_webny_news_subject_heading | Behat |
    Then I should see the heading "My article with fields!"
    And I should see the text "A placeholder"
    Then I should see in the header "X-Cache":"MISS"
    When I reload the page
    Then I should see in the header "X-Cache":"HIT"
    Then I want the varnish cache to go the way of the dinosaurs
